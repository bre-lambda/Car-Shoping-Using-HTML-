<H3>we have so many Bus and Cars to sell</H3>
<P>Selling a car is never much fun. Do so privately and you'll be lucky not to have to deal with at least one time-waster. Go via a
dealer and you'll struggle to make what you might through a private sale. Therefore it's no surprise that online services are becoming increasingly popular.
The online option is broadly split into two camps. The first are companies (such as the high-profile Webuyanycar.com) that offer an
instant valuation over the internet and then have collection points for cars. The second are glorified car dealers who
negotiate over the phone, pay for and collect the car themselves, and usually sell on to the trade <img src="buss.jpg"width="200"height="100"/><br>
